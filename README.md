# XGBoost_regression

## This jupyter notebook uses data from an agricultural csv showing crop yiels and produce in different states and seeks to predict the produce. XGBoost regression is the distributed computing framework used. 

# Hyperparameter tuning

## This ensures the model doesn't overfit or underfit and also ensures no data leakage. Data leakage is the instance where the ML model perfoms way better on training data and very poorly in testing data. For further tuning, the parameters of the param_grid have to be added to ensure the model perfoms accurately. 

# Feature engineering

## XGBoost offers a library for graphing the features in our file that influence our target variable.

# Accuracy

## The model has a runtime of 194 seconds, a Root Mean squared error of 1.12606.
